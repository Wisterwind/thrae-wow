	* Dongle.toc: * Dongle is now load on demand. This shouldn't make a
	  difference, but may be more convenient for development.

	* Dongle.lua: * Altered the ADDON_LOADED handler. If Dongle is
	  loaded _after_ PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD, we check for IsLoggedIn()

	* Tests/04DongleMessage.lua: * Removed DongleObject checks, since
	  they can be used in a normal table.

	* Dongle.lua: * DongleMessage does not require a Dongle object
	  anymore, so non-Dongle objects can register for our custom
	  messages.

2007-03-21 [r264]  Tekkub:

2007-03-01 [r250-251]  jnwhiteh:

	* UnitTests.lua, Tests/04DongleMessage.lua, Tests/02DongleCore.lua,
	  Tests/03DongleModules.lua, Tests/06DongleDB.lua,
	  Tests/01DongleStub.lua, Tests/05DonglePrint.lua,
	  Tests/07DongleSlash.lua, Tests/08DongleError.lua (added),
	  Tests/99Completion.lua (added), DongleUnitTests.toc: * Renamed
	  04DongleEvents.lua to 04DongleMessage.lua in the .toc so it loads
	  properly * Added a naming argument to UnitTest:New() that
	  requires a name, so we can track which tests have been run, and
	  which have not. If you add a test file, you need to add that to
	  99Completion.lua. * Removed all ferror functions, and replaced
	  them with a global argerror function. * Added a unit test for
	  IsMessageRegistered() * Added a 08DongleError.lua file, which
	  tests the argcheck and assert custom functions, to ensure they
	  throw their errors at the correct level. * Changed the unit test
	  harness to use xpcall() so we can get a full internal stack
	  trace.

	* Build.lua, Dongle.lua, DongleUtils.lua: * Updated copyright
	  notice in license * Added DongleObj:IsEventRegistered() * Added
	  DongleObj:IsMessageRegistered() * Moved all error messages into a
	  small localisation table * Moved DB local function declarations
	  to the start of the DB section for declaration purpose * Altered
	  the database to lazy evaluate all sections of the database. This
	  means that any database section (.profile, .char, .faction) will
	  not be initialized (including defaults) until accessed * Removed
	  db.profileKey, you can access this value via db.char.profileKey
	  and db.keys.profile * Added table db.keys which lists all section
	  keys * Removed all local db .key references. * Altered slash
	  command system to check cmd[handler] before it checks
	  parent[handler] to allow definition of methods within the slash
	  command table itself. * Added a message handler for
	  DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED * Incremented major version to
	  Dongle-Beta1 * Added preliminary support for namespaces, which
	  needs to be fully converted and tested.
	  DongleDBObject:RegisterNamespace(name[, defaults]) Args: * name
	  (string) - An internal name for this namespace * defaults (table)
	  - A table expressing defaults for this namespace Returns: * db
	  (DongleDBObject) - The new database object. A namespace is a full
	  fledged database with all rights and privileges, but has the
	  following nuances: Behavior: * A namespace is created without a
	  global variable, under the sv.namespaces[name] portion of the
	  parent saved variable. This means you can have multiple modules
	  that have full fledged database objects without needing more than
	  one global variable. * When a parent database (namespaces are
	  children) changes its profile (i.e. when DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED
	  fires), each child will be automatically updated (they will fire
	  their own DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED messages). * These namespace
	  objects do not fire a true "sv_name" in the event, nore do they
	  fire a Dongle object as the parent. Instead they will fire the
	  "parent" database object, and the sv object as the sv_name. All
	  namespace features are untagged, and the API may change, consider
	  that feature extremely experimental.

2007-01-08 [r219-220]  jnwhiteh:

2007-01-08 [r209]  jnwhiteh:

	* DongleStub.lua: Donglestub: Change deactivate and activate to
	  arguments to register Altered the way the code is written to be
	  more in line with Iriels' original stub If the activate function
	  returns true, then the old instance will not be touched Upgrade
	  order is Deactivate, Activate, nil/copy. Not sure if this is
	  right.

	  the new methods into the old objects Cleaned up lib:Register()
	  and made it a bit more in-line with the original spec. Now stores
	  all old instances in a list, so we can iterate them later.
	  Process remains new:Activate() then old:Deactivate() then the
	  method copy. Expected signatures for Activate and Deactivate have
	  changed: new:Activate(self, oldInstance, oldList)
	  oldInstance:Deactivate(self, oldList, newInstance)
