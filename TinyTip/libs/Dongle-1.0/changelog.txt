	  Fixed configuration not being parented to OH * Changed
	  updateConfigList to also open the panel if you pass true as the
	  first argument * Changed OptionHouse:Open(addon, parentCat,

	  should cause less issues and work perfectly now

2007-08-30 [r598]  jnwhiteh:

	* Dongle.lua: * Fix when accessing profileKeys, which exists in sv
	  instead of db

2007-08-29 [r597]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Removed reset filters button, it
	  seems rather pointless and just wastes space

2007-08-29 [r593]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Fixed OptionHouse:Open not opening
	  categories with sub categories

2007-08-28 [r592]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: OptionHouse - Shoving everything up to

2007-08-25 [r591]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * OptionHouse:Open() actually works
	  now, promise

2007-08-24 [r590]  shadowed.wow:

	  trimming so it doesn't overflow

2007-08-24 [r589]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Fixed a few scroll functions not
	  being actual functions and instead anonymous ones * Added
	  OptionHouseFrames[type] for usage when you can't/don't want to
	  create a new instance of OptionHouse just to call :GetFrame()

2007-08-22 [r588]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Formatting addon.name into the
	  argcheck was kind of pointless...because the argcheck is only
	  called if addon.name is nil, corrected to use the function name
	  instead

2007-08-20 [r587]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Removed the code for loading LoD
	  deps as the game does it by default

	  <addon> will now work for opening the page with the passed addon
	  * Fixed OptionHouse:Open and all of the OptionHouse:Register*
	  functions that were still using the old frame names * Dependency
	  filtering works now, the dependencies are colored by status
	  (Green means LoD, Orange means not LoD and was disabled and so
	  on), works the same as modules. Click on a dependency to filter
	  by it, click on it again to reset * Fixed sub category count not
	  being reduced correctly when removing a category * Fixed all the
	  remaining bugs with OptionHouse:RemoveCategory and
	  OptionHouse:RemoveSubCategory, you can now remove everything
	  cleanly and it'll correctly duplicate the behaviors as if it was
	  never registered in the first place, if you remove all of the
	  addons categories/sub categories the addon wont be listed anymore
	  until you add another category

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Removed

	  * Removed dependencies from tooltip since it's listed on the main
	  window * Removed addonName from rows, easier to use it as addon
	  since we don't require a numeric id * Added reset filter button,
	  ReloadUI was shifted one spot to the left * Clarified UNKNOWN_TAB
	  and CATEGORY_ALREADYREG error, removed TOTAL_CATEGORIES *
	  Formatting change to some code for consistency * Moved
	  SetID/SetScript to when the tab is created, no sense in calling
	  it all the time * Fixed removeCategoryListing so it'll actually
	  work when removing multiple rows * Changed
	  removeSubCategoryListing to use the same table.remove method as
	  everything else

2007-08-17 [r579]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Removed FRAME_DRAGGING
	  localization text, unneeded * Removed data.frame.time = GetTime()
	  code, should have been removed in r460 * Moved the slider
	  "border" graphic to scroll.barUpTexture and scroll.barDownTexture
	  so we can customize positioning

2007-08-17 [r578]  shadowed.wow:

	  frames first shown * Tweaked positioning of elements in the
	  performance column

2007-08-15 [r571]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua: * Oops, was formatting wrong variable
	  in for MiR

2007-08-15 [r570]  shadowed.wow:

	  a bug that was causing Mac's to crash due to an invalid max value
	  * Changed Memory/sec -> Mem/sec

2007-08-15 [r569]  JoshBorke:

	  OH_AddOns.lua the entire addons table is only populated once and
	  then individual addons are updated when needed * Added status for
	  Load on Demand addons that are already loaded * Added parent
	  addon detection. For example LightHeaded, LightHeaded_A20_Data,
	  LightHeaded_A40_Data. A20_Data and A40_Data are children of
	  LightHeaded you can only show addons that are children of
	  LightHeaded by clicking on the "LightHeaded" text in the parent
	  column, you can also sort by parent just like name and status

2007-08-15 [r567]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Fixed results of a search being
	  shown at the bottom

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse: fixed leaked global

2007-08-15 [r565]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua: * Added in total memory and total CPU
	  onto the sort bar things, positioning is messed up, I'll pretend
	  I don't know about it and hope someone else (Josh) fixes it

2007-08-15 [r564]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua: * Now I remember why we needed
	  that "or 1" part

2007-08-15 [r560]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua: * Fixed performance monitor

2007-08-14 [r559]  shadowed.wow:

2007-08-14 [r557]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.toc: *
	  Everything previous commit is actually true now

2007-08-13 [r556]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Fixed most of the inconsistencies
	  for code formatting * Added a new feature that will enable all
	  the children of an addon, for example if you enable BigWigs
	  you'll be asked if you want to enable all of the BigWigs_*
	  modules, like dependencies you can set this to always ask, always
	  enable, never enable * In theory all this stuff works fine, in
	  practice OH is now horribly broken

2007-08-13 [r555]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Using "Disable All" will keep
	  OptionHouse enabled, you can still disable it manually through
	  the addon control panel * If a load on demand addon has load on
	  demand dependencies then the dependencies are automatically
	  loaded then the addon

2007-08-13 [r554]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Fixed highlight texture not

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: *
	  All of the frames except for tabs, FSF and main OptionHouse are
	  unnamed * New API OptionHouse:GetFrame() accepts main, addon,
	  manage, perf these should be used in place of directly
	  referencing a frame

2007-08-13 [r551]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Seems "doublewide" is
	  bugged, workaround until slouken implements a fix

2007-08-12 [r550]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Fixed OptionHouse not working
	  correctly as an UI frame meaning no more overlapping errors *
	  Because OptionHouse is now a UI frame the ability to move it has
	  been removed * If an addon has dependencies that aren't load on
	  demand, the "Load" button wont show up and the text will be in
	  orange

2007-08-11 [r546]  shadowed.wow:

	  log is actually true now

	  Changed createRows to only create the test font string when it
	  doesn't exist already * updateManageList is called in
	  createManageList, it was pointless to have to call them
	  seperately * Removed all of the remaining globals, only ones
	  remaining are the main frames, scroll frames and tabs * Code
	  cleanup

2007-08-10 [r544]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Ninja fix, close button works, clad
	  will never know

2007-08-08 [r537]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: * Rows are used as needed, meaning you
	  can change the text size and see the results without a UI reload
	  * When enabling an addon, if it has any dependencies they'll be
	  enabled you can change this to always enable, never enable or ask
	  through configuration * Some small code tweaks

2007-08-07 [r536]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua:

	  OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: *
	  All font options will work now, the configuration should be fully
	  usable * Moving works, if you have standalone it'll save the
	  positioning you can right click to reset it to the standard one,
	  you can drag it using the title bar where "Option House" text is
	  located

2007-07-10 [r519]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua: *
	  Fixed a couple of bugs in the configuration, they'll actually
	  show and position correctly now * Fixed tab
	  registering/unregistering, so it actually works now * Fixed a

	  error if none is found * Fixed a couple of errors in
	  configuration

2007-07-10 [r517]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua: OptionHouse - Why not sort the perf
	  tab by title instead of name, for consistency with the addon tab
	  and the charselect addon panel

2007-07-09 [r516]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua: *

	  fixed positioning errors (hopefully) * Added an option to lock
	  the OptionHouse window, haven't actually implemented the code to

	  OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua,
	  OptionHouse/Build.lua: * Added OptionHouse:UnregisterTab(text) so
	  we can remove the tabs when people disable/enable them * Changed
	  the "security" checking to only accept tabs with the text
	  Management or Performance, to make life easier * Added in all of
	  the base code + configuration to OptionHouse, it should
	  unregister/register tabs just fine but the font size doesn't work
	  yet

2007-07-06 [r513]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_Configuration.lua (added),

	  it shouldn't be anything since it's seconds increased CPU time
	  used.

	* OptionHouse/Build.lua: * Verbiage fix for the library import

	  DongleStub into a file. We don't work that way. * Added
	  DongleStub.lua from branches/Dongle-1.1 to OptionHouse * Added
	  DongleStub.lua to the .toc file * Version numbers should be
	  meaningful, the revision number in the .toc is useless.. use the
	  major version number.

2007-07-03 [r481]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Not including DongleStub was
	  probably bad.

2007-07-03 [r479]  shadowed.wow:

2007-06-27 [r473]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added some quick validation to
	  OptionHouse:OpenTab() so you can't open one that doesn't exist.

2007-06-27 [r472]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Fixed
	  sorting in management frame to actually work, also fixed sorting
	  going by colors not the actual title itself. Fixed tooltips in
	  management Fixed the addon panels not showing and throwing an
	  error Added OptionHouse:GetAddOnData back

2007-06-27 [r471]  JoshBorke:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse: - attempted fix for
	  tainting stuff

2007-06-26 [r470]  JoshBorke:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: OptionHouse: - fix bugs introduced by
	  Shadowed's recent changes - issecurevariable checks RegisterTab
	  instead of self now - revert new syntax for CreateTab until
	  shadowed fixes it better - check for existence of addon in
	  OH_AddOns - delete trailing white spaces

2007-06-25 [r469]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Cleaned
	  up code in OptionHouse.lua Moved the addon list in management to
	  when you search, new addon loaded, enabled/disabled or loaded
	  something instead of whenever you resort, scroll and basically
	  anything.

2007-06-25 [r468]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua, OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Testing
	  validation stuff

2007-06-25 [r467]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added issecurevariable checking so
	  only OptionHouse modules can register tabs, create search inputs
	  or get addon data.

2007-06-23 [r463-466]  jnwhiteh:

	* DongleStub/DongleStub.lua: * Property update on DongleStub

	* DongleStub/DongleStub.lua: * Are keywords case-sensitive?

	* DongleCore/DongleCore.lua: * Updated keywords to include Revision
	  and Id (in theory)

	* DongleCore/DongleCore.lua: * Added $id$ keyword

2007-06-23 [r462]  JoshBorke:

	* OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: OptionHouse: - sort addons ascending
	  by name by default

2007-06-21 [r461]  JoshBorke:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse: no longer have lines
	  with extraneous whitespace

2007-06-21 [r460]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Josh is whiny, moved expanded
	  categories too a separate function called on expand/search Fixed
	  a couple of callback issues due to code changes Added OptionHouse
	  title too the top bar Frame level changed to MEDIUM for OH and
	  HIGH for addon registered pages, need to play around with it
	  still Probably did some other things, but if I didn't remember
	  them not really important

2007-06-21 [r459]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Fixed addons tab, everything will work
	  correctly now. Changed Joshs formatting, he sucks Changed the
	  name for performance/management too title and not addon name Did
	  some other stuff, probably not importent NTS: Add validation

2007-06-21 [r458]  JoshBorke:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: OptionHouse: - added Status to Addons
	  - fixed the tabs to show properly - addon option handlers aren't
	  being called

2007-06-21 [r457]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Fixes before heading home

2007-06-20 [r456]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Fuck trying to manage what data I
	  want using numbers, changed all of the expandedCategories info to
	  stored by keys for sanity. Changed the expanding code to store
	  the data array instead of setting 4-5 variables to the button
	  OptionHouse:Open("addon", "cat", "subCat") should be back and
	  actually working now Cleaned up the configuration showing code so
	  it can be used in areas besides when a button is clicked Added a
	  tooltip to the buttons on configuration, will show
	  title/version/author on the configuration buttons, and will also
	  show sub categories count when mousing over a category.

2007-06-20 [r455]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Renamed tabs, AddOn Configuration ->
	  Addons, AddOn Management -> Management, AddOn Performance ->
	  Performance.

2007-06-20 [r454]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua, OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua: Split OH off to modules, untested but
	  it's the basic idea code-wise of what they'll look like, making
	  sure the APIs are actually private needs to be done still (cause
	  clad fails).

2007-06-20 [r453]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added argument passing to the
	  registered functions, note that they will pass "" instead of nil
	  for sub categories if none is there for now due to lazyness

2007-06-20 [r452]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added category/sub category passing
	  to the registered functions, probably broken but Josh is a
	  whiner.

2007-06-19 [r451]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OH_PerfMon.lua (added), OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua,
	  OptionHouse/OH_AddOns.lua (added), OptionHouse/OptionHouse.toc:
	  Icon will be used if standalone is found, added new files for the
	  basic stuff, cladhaire fails at issecurevariable.

2007-06-18 [r450]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Stupid Mikma breaking stuff. Fixed
	  #959 and #983 errors

2007-06-18 [r449]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Changed to upvalue (Josh fails)

2007-06-18 [r448]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: expandedCategories changed too
	  OptionHouseOptionsFrame.expanded, re-used instead of re-created
	  every time in updateConfigList().

2007-06-18 [r447]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Cleaned up more of the code
	  formatting, split off category sorting to a separate function
	  thats only ran when OptionHouseOptionFrame is created, or when a
	  new addon is registered.

2007-06-18 [r446]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Title will use the one from
	  GetAddOnInfo if nothing is registered with OH when displaying
	  tooltip info, also the tooltip will add the data as it comes
	  meaning it can show title/version even without author, or
	  title/author/dependencies with no version found.

2007-06-17 [r445]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added OHObject:RemoveCategory(
	  "name" ) and OHObject:RemoveSubCategory( "parentCat", "name" )
	  for addons that use profiles, eg ItemRack type of things. Fixed a
	  couple of assert validation types of errors in the Register*
	  functions. Fixed sorting on the category panel

2007-06-17 [r444]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Fixed numbers not being a valid type
	  when passing version in RegisterAddOn OH was positioning frames
	  incorrectly, they'll actually move when OH is moved now.

2007-06-17 [r443]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Fixed performance sorting using mir
	  instead of cir for cir sorting. Fixed a search being done on the
	  category when only one category and no sub categories exist Fixed
	  dependencies not showing (you need to return apparently) Added :
	  after Option House in ENTERED_COMBAT, forgot to. Cleaned up some
	  of the loops for sorting creation

2007-06-17 [r442]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: * Removing the local copy of
	  DongleStub.lua

2007-06-17 [r441]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Removed the portrait and replaced it
	  with the characters since embeds can't use TGAs because authors
	  are more bitchy then users

2007-06-17 [r440]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse/OptionHouse.lua: Added sorting to the management
	  frame, can sort by status or name, fixed a couple of reasons not
	  displaying, cleaned up the color code too. The reason text will
	  move to the position "Load" is if it's not a LoD addon. Added
	  dependencies to the tooltip on addon management

2007-06-16 [r439]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse (added): Moving OptionHouse to trunk

2007-06-16 [r438]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed size validation, positioning will work now
	  it was off by around 105 y, OH will now force the
	  OptionHouseOptionsFrame to be the parent of configuration frames
	  Fixed OH not getting any data from addons that are registered
	  with it in the management page Management page is broken since it
	  doesn't fully implement all the reasons (Damn Tekkub)

2007-06-16 [r437]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed size tests, height was being changed if it
	  was > 305 instead of 630, and width was being changed if it was >
	  630 instead of 305.

2007-06-15 [r436]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Changed this -> self, anything thats broken is
	  Tekkubs fault.

2007-06-15 [r435]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Bumped major to OptionHouse-1.0, pray and hope
	  we never need to change the API.

2007-06-15 [r434]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed major number, OptionHouse-Alpha0.1 now

2007-06-15 [r433]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed the open configuration panel not hiding
	  when switching tabs

2007-06-15 [r432]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - KB --> KiB, MB --> MiB

2007-06-15 [r431]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Added OptionHouse:OpenTab( 1-3 ) (1 config/2
	  manage/3 perf) /oh will accept arguments, meaning you can do /oh
	  SSPVP to open the SSPVP category, or /oh Panda to open the Panda
	  category. Removed the tabOnClick calls in createOHFrame moved
	  them to OptionHouse:Open() and OptionHouse:OpenTab()

2007-06-15 [r430]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: In theory, you can now do OptionHouse:Open(
	  [addon][, category][, subcategory] ) to specify what
	  configuration is shown at the start.

2007-06-15 [r429]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Changed major to OptionHouse-Alpha0.1

2007-06-15 [r427-428]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse-old.lua (removed): Not needed anymore

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed enable check box for ms.whiny mc whine
	  pants Fixed a couple lines of code and changed the formatting
	  used for some of them.

2007-06-15 [r426]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Auto-frame positioning will only happen if
	  GetPoint() returns nil, also changed the frame size setting too
	  only happen if it's wider then 630 or higher then 305, or if the
	  current width and/or height are 0.

2007-06-15 [r425]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Fixed the addon configuration page, made it sort
	  the addons by alpha, the category listing will reset when you
	  change panels too. Added in default positioning (TOPLEFT, 190,
	  -103) and height/width (630/305) Cleaned up the configuration
	  code and fixed a few bugs in the search

2007-06-14 [r424]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Performance/management pages will work,
	  management will register ADDON_LOADED now too, you can mouseover
	  addons in management to view the full title/version/author, will
	  make it support the OH title also if it exists. Options broken,
	  will deal with later

2007-06-14 [r423]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua-bk (removed), OptionHouse-old.lua (added),
	  OptionHouse.lua: Renamed OptionHouse.lua-bk to lazy too right
	  click and choose which editor to open it in. Pulled
	  OptionHouse.lua into an embed and also cleaned up all the
	  code/functions/naming, still a couple of things need to be done
	  like adding a tooltip for the management page, and actually test
	  everything but the actual code is all implemented, normalized and
	  ready to go. Category will reset when you change tabs and is also
	  sorted in alpha order

2007-06-14 [r422]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua-bk (added), OptionHouse.lua: Moved the actual OH
	  code to OptionHouse.lua-bk for grabbing code to move to the
	  "final" code base. Figuring out how I managed to fuck up
	  $Revision$

2007-06-12 [r421]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Added searching, will filter by
	  addon/category/subcategory on the configuration panel and name on
	  the management/performance page. Used hack method for management
	  page due to Tekkubs crazy-ass code. Fixed an error when a frame
	  is added with OH being shown.

2007-06-09 [r420]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Changed positioning of performance stuff
	  slightly

2007-06-08 [r419]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.toc, AddonPage.lua (removed), DongleFrames.lua
	  (removed), OptionHouse.lua: Removed the usage of AddonPage.lua
	  and DongleFrames.lua as they were only used for examples (and
	  lord cladhaire is whiny). Added CPU per second (position needs
	  checking) Fixed unloaded addons showing

2007-06-08 [r418]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Another round of
	  getglobal/blah:GetName() removals... next up: removing frame
	  names that aren't needed (stop cluttering the global namespace
	  with frame names!)

2007-06-07 [r417]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Fixed tab selection (again :P) -
	  Removed some unneeded calls to getglobal and frame:GetName()

2007-06-07 [r416]  tekkub:

	* AddonPage.lua: OptionHouse - Fixed parenting of the sample config
	  frames so they hide on tab changes

2007-06-07 [r415]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Added memory per second to the performance tab,
	  also made it update once a second while the frame is open for
	  CPU/Memory/MiR updating. You can now sort all of the columns due
	  to lord cladhaires request.

2007-06-07 [r414]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.lua: Category selection will work completely now
	  including when an addon only has one category and no
	  subcategories registered Added in the performance page, will sort
	  by highest memory when CPU profiling is disabled, and highest
	  memory + CPU when it's on Changed the metadata grabbing for
	  management and performance to also check the list of registered
	  addons for getting author and version data

2007-06-07 [r413]  shadowed.wow:

	* AddonPage.lua, OptionHouse.lua: Switched category selection back
	  too text detection not ids since it's easier to detect whats
	  open/closed Improved the Filter_UpdateList code, it'll actually
	  work now with setting a function and/or handler Added noCache
	  argument to RegisterSubCategory and RegisterCategory for lord
	  Thrae, when you pass the noCache flag it wont save the frame and
	  will call the function and/or handler everytime.

2007-06-07 [r412]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Nudging scroll bar a tad to close
	  gaps

2007-06-07 [r411]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Oh look, I found the background
	  texture for scroll bars... why doesn't FSF use this?

2007-06-07 [r410]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Added ESC menu button

2007-06-06 [r409]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - It might be fake, but it scrolls!

2007-06-06 [r408]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Reworked title fontstrings to
	  prevent wrapping/overflow, but still use as much space as is
	  available

2007-06-06 [r407]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Let's not clutter up the global
	  namespace with frames

2007-06-06 [r406]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Enable/disable all buttons added

2007-06-06 [r405]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Color addon name for some cases
	  (LoD, Disabled, Error) - Checkbox now enable/disables - Added
	  reloadui button

2007-06-06 [r404]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Management tab now shows real
	  data, but doesn't scroll or enable/disable yet

2007-06-06 [r403]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Oh look, the tabs actually do
	  something now.

2007-06-05 [r402]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Only register sample addons on
	  first load

2007-06-05 [r401]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - More tab stuff, why were we
	  calling getglobal(frame:GetName()... when we know the frame's
	  name is a constant?

2007-06-05 [r400]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - Fixing tab selection on first open

2007-06-05 [r399]  jnwhiteh:

	* Build.lua, DongleCore (added), svn2log.py (removed),
	  DongleHelloWorld (added), DongleStub (added), DongleStub.lua
	  (removed), Dongle.lua (removed), DongleUtils.lua (removed), lunit
	  (added), Dongle.toc (removed): * Moved Dongle-1.1 from trunk to
	  branches * Moved Dongle-2.0 from branches to trunk

2007-06-05 [r398]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionHouse.toc, AddonPage.lua, OptionHouse.lua: Added in
	  OptionHouse:RegisterAddOn, addonObj:RegisterCategory,
	  addonObj:RegisterSubCategory. RegisterAddOn will return an
	  addonObj that can be used for the category and sub category
	  registering, currently the filters page will support this but
	  they don't actually call the frames functions yet, have to work
	  out a solution to figure out what function/handler to call. Moved
	  DongleFrames/AddonPage to load before OptionHouse, also modified
	  AddonPage to use the Register* functions as an example.

2007-06-04 [r397]  jnwhiteh:

	* Dongle.lua: * Updating major revision in trunk

2007-05-31 [r393]  shadowed.wow:

	* AddonPage.lua: Silly Tekkub, "OptionHouseFrame" not
	  "OptionsHouseFrame"

2007-05-31 [r392]  tekkub:

	* OptionHouse.lua: OptionHouse - ESC is a good thing

2007-05-31 [r389-391]  tekkub:

	* OptionsHouse.lua (removed), OptionHouse.toc (added),
	  AddonPage.lua, OptionsHouse.toc (removed), GnomePortrait.tga,
	  DongleFrames.lua, OptionHouse.lua (added): Renaming OptionsHouse
	  >> OptionHouse, part 2

	* OptionHouse.lua (added), OptionsHouse.lua (removed),
	  OptionHouse.toc (added), OptionsHouse.toc (removed): Renaming
	  OptionsHouse >> OptionHouse, part 1

	* OptionsHouse.lua, AddonPage.lua (added), OptionsHouse.toc,
	  DongleFrames.lua (added): OptionHouse - Adding sample config
	  frame generator

2007-05-30 [r388]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: * Comment out a bad line, so we don't error for
	  right now.

2007-05-30 [r387]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua, GnomePortrait.tga (added): * Added Mikk's
	  portrait texture

2007-05-30 [r386]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Modifying buttons in LUA sucks. Changed text
	  positioning so it's aligned to the left, text is moved over to
	  the right by 8px for categories, and 20px for sub-categories,
	  also moved some code around.

2007-05-30 [r385]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Changed
	  left-sided-quest-thing-that-we-need-a-name-for to use IDs instead
	  of text.

2007-05-30 [r384]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Reverted sub-category count showing up next to
	  name, fixed a couple of positionings, and also removed local oh =
	  frame because clad is silly.

2007-05-30 [r383]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Added number of sub categories if any next to
	  the categories name.

2007-05-30 [r382]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Added scroll frame support, go to SSPVP -> Join
	  for an example of the scroll frame.

2007-05-30 [r381]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Changed local name to "OptionsHouseFrame" for
	  consistency with all the object naming. Added filters in, hack
	  example code, because they work like the AH filters you can have
	  as many categories as you want per an addon, but only one
	  sub-category. Added a quick example table of an addon just to
	  make the example actually work. Moved frame to a local of
	  OptionsHouse.lua instead of makeOptionsFrame, since the filter
	  and tab stuff needs the frame object.

2007-05-29 [r380]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: * I'm lazy, use the player portait texture
	  until I can bribe Mikk

2007-05-29 [r379]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: * Frame is now draggable and clamped to screen
	  * Only the title bar is draggable, may be off by a few pixels,
	  feel free to adjust * Added slash command /oh for dev, cause I'm
	  lazy

2007-05-29 [r378]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: * Frame will only be shown when you use the
	  /opthouse slash command

2007-05-29 [r377]  shadowed.wow:

	* OptionsHouse.lua: Fixed tabs so they'll actually resize too the
	  text. Also moved the tabs name from "OptionsHouseTabX" to
	  "OptionsHouseFrameTabX" because the old naming was causing issues
	  when using the PanelTemplates_* functions, tabs should function
	  like they do on the auction house UI now. Renamed the
	  "Enable/Disable Addon" tab to "Addon Management" to be more
	  consistant with the other ones, and because it makes more sense.

2007-05-29 [r376]  jnwhiteh:

	* OptionsHouse.lua (added), OptionsHouse.toc (added): * Added .toc
	  and .lua for initial OptionsHouse work

2007-05-23 [r373-374]  jnwhiteh:

	* DongleUnitTests.toc: * .toc update for 2.1.0

	* Dongle.toc: * .toc update for 2.1.0

	  instead of the db

	* Dongle.lua: * Fixing an issue where profile selections will not
	  persist across sessions

2007-05-22 [r369]  jnwhiteh:

	* Dongle.lua: * Fix an issue where profile selections aren't

2007-05-20 [r363]  jnwhiteh:

	  they can be used in a normal table.

	* Dongle.lua: * DongleMessage does not require a Dongle object

	  Tests/01DongleStub.lua, Tests/05DonglePrint.lua,
	  Tests/07DongleSlash.lua, Tests/08DongleError.lua (added),
	  Tests/99Completion.lua (added), DongleUnitTests.toc: * Renamed
	  04DongleEvents.lua to 04DongleMessage.lua in the .toc so it loads
	  properly * Added a naming argument to UnitTest:New() that
	  requires a name, so we can track which tests have been run, and
	  which have not. If you add a test file, you need to add that to
	  99Completion.lua. * Removed all ferror functions, and replaced
	  them with a global argerror function. * Added a unit test for
	  IsMessageRegistered() * Added a 08DongleError.lua file, which
	  tests the argcheck and assert custom functions, to ensure they
	  throw their errors at the correct level. * Changed the unit test
	  harness to use xpcall() so we can get a full internal stack
	  trace.

	* Build.lua, Dongle.lua, DongleUtils.lua: * Updated copyright
	  notice in license * Added DongleObj:IsEventRegistered() * Added
	  DongleObj:IsMessageRegistered() * Moved all error messages into a
	  small localisation table * Moved DB local function declarations
	  to the start of the DB section for declaration purpose * Altered
	  the database to lazy evaluate all sections of the database. This
	  means that any database section (.profile, .char, .faction) will
	  not be initialized (including defaults) until accessed * Removed
	  db.profileKey, you can access this value via db.char.profileKey
	  and db.keys.profile * Added table db.keys which lists all section
	  keys * Removed all local db .key references. * Altered slash
	  command system to check cmd[handler] before it checks
	  parent[handler] to allow definition of methods within the slash
	  command table itself. * Added a message handler for
	  DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED * Incremented major version to
	  Dongle-Beta1 * Added preliminary support for namespaces, which
	  needs to be fully converted and tested.
	  DongleDBObject:RegisterNamespace(name[, defaults]) Args: * name
	  (string) - An internal name for this namespace * defaults (table)
	  - A table expressing defaults for this namespace Returns: * db
	  (DongleDBObject) - The new database object. A namespace is a full
	  fledged database with all rights and privileges, but has the
	  following nuances: Behavior: * A namespace is created without a
	  global variable, under the sv.namespaces[name] portion of the
	  parent saved variable. This means you can have multiple modules
	  that have full fledged database objects without needing more than
	  one global variable. * When a parent database (namespaces are
	  children) changes its profile (i.e. when DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED
	  fires), each child will be automatically updated (they will fire
	  their own DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED messages). * These namespace
	  objects do not fire a true "sv_name" in the event, nore do they
	  fire a Dongle object as the parent. Instead they will fire the
	  "parent" database object, and the sv object as the sv_name. All
	  namespace features are untagged, and the API may change, consider
	  that feature extremely experimental.

2007-01-08 [r209]  jnwhiteh:

	* DongleStub.lua: Donglestub: Change deactivate and activate to
	  arguments to register Altered the way the code is written to be
	  more in line with Iriels' original stub If the activate function
	  returns true, then the old instance will not be touched Upgrade
	  order is Deactivate, Activate, nil/copy. Not sure if this is
	  right.

2007-01-07 [r206-208]  evlogimenos:

	* Dongle.lua: Add slash command objects upgrade code.

	* Dongle.lua: Add checks for slash command methods to make sure

2007-01-05 [r203-204]  jnwhiteh:

	* DongleStub.lua: Changed some of the system to store an old list

	  introduced. This is something we probably need to be doing anyway
	  Added a ReplaceInstance function from Iriel's stub which copies
	  the new methods into the old objects Cleaned up lib:Register()
	  and made it a bit more in-line with the original spec. Now stores
	  all old instances in a list, so we can iterate them later.
	  Process remains new:Activate() then old:Deactivate() then the
	  method copy. Expected signatures for Activate and Deactivate have
	  changed: new:Activate(self, oldInstance, oldList)
	  oldInstance:Deactivate(self, oldList, newInstance)

	* Dongle.lua: Incremented version to Dongle-Beta1. This is a
	  preliminary version,and won't be tagged for a week or so. Removed

	  string.format() when necessary * Added a /dongle {enable|disable}
	  AddonName which disables and enables addons from the commandline
	  * Added a /reload which reloads the UI.
