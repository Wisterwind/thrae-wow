2007-03-01 [r250]  jnwhiteh:

	* Build.lua, Dongle.lua, DongleUtils.lua: * Updated copyright
	  notice in license * Added DongleObj:IsEventRegistered() * Added
	  DongleObj:IsMessageRegistered() * Moved all error messages into a
	  small localisation table * Moved DB local function declarations
	  to the start of the DB section for declaration purpose * Altered
	  the database to lazy evaluate all sections of the database. This
	  means that any database section (.profile, .char, .faction) will
	  not be initialized (including defaults) until accessed * Removed
	  db.profileKey, you can access this value via db.char.profileKey
	  and db.keys.profile * Added table db.keys which lists all section
	  keys * Removed all local db .key references. * Altered slash
	  command system to check cmd[handler] before it checks
	  parent[handler] to allow definition of methods within the slash
	  command table itself. * Added a message handler for
	  DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED * Incremented major version to
	  Dongle-Beta1 * Added preliminary support for namespaces, which
	  needs to be fully converted and tested.
	  DongleDBObject:RegisterNamespace(name[, defaults]) Args: * name
	  (string) - An internal name for this namespace * defaults (table)
	  - A table expressing defaults for this namespace Returns: * db
	  (DongleDBObject) - The new database object. A namespace is a full
	  fledged database with all rights and privileges, but has the
	  following nuances: Behavior: * A namespace is created without a
	  global variable, under the sv.namespaces[name] portion of the
	  parent saved variable. This means you can have multiple modules
	  that have full fledged database objects without needing more than
	  one global variable. * When a parent database (namespaces are
	  children) changes its profile (i.e. when DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED
	  fires), each child will be automatically updated (they will fire
	  their own DONGLE_PROFILE_CHANGED messages). * These namespace
	  objects do not fire a true "sv_name" in the event, nore do they
	  fire a Dongle object as the parent. Instead they will fire the
	  "parent" database object, and the sv object as the sv_name. All
	  namespace features are untagged, and the API may change, consider
	  that feature extremely experimental.

	* Dongle.lua: Dongle: Fixed event registration, Enable/Init should
	  now work properly

2006-11-20 [r23]  jnwhiteh:

	* Dongle.lua: Dongle: * Added UnregisterAllEvents() * Moved
	  DongleStub registration code to the bottom of the file, for
	  consistency * Changed logic in method replacement, replacement is
	  now destructive * Changed event dispatch to be a simple
	  iteration, pulled the extra logic out to other functions *
	  Dongle:ADDON_LOADED() now handles event dispatch *
	  Dongle:AdminEvents() handles the PLAYER_LOGIN/LOGOUT/etc. events
	  * Added faction determination using UnitRace() when
	  UnitFactionGroup() isn't available * We now register for our
	  events using the Dongle system itself. * Call
	  self:UnregisterAllEvents() when we deactivate an instance of
	  Dongle

	  should work now, but needs to be cleaned up.

2006-11-19 [r21]  jnwhiteh:

	* Dongle.lua: Dongle: * Changed initialization system so it queues
	  all unloaded dongles, and initializes then on the next
	  ADDON_LOADED. This means load on demand addons should work just
	  fine, but anything created after PLAYER_LOGIN (i.e. in TinyPad)
	  won't fire until the next ADDON_LOADED. In short, don't do it, or
	  handle it yourself.

2006-11-16 [r13]  jnwhiteh:

	  major entry * Fixed :Print() so it properly does a
	  string.format() when necessary * Added a /dongle {enable|disable}
